About
----------
The Munki Enrollment Server (MES) is a web application written in Python.  It is the server compliment to the Munki Enrollment Client (MEC), providing a method of enrolling Mac systems with Munki for certificate-based communication thereafter.

Communication between the MEC and the MES is encrypted in transit with HTTPS.  Based on input from the Munki Enrollment Client (MEC), it handles:
   * creating a computer manifest for an enrolling computer if necessary,
   * generating client PKI materials (private keys, certificates) from its local CA and returning them to the client,
   * associating computer manifests with group manifests by modifying their _included_manifests_ keys,
   * providing clients with their manifest data and a list of available group manifests.

A concept of a server like this appears to have originated around 2012 with Cody Eding's munki-enroll web app.

The MES is written in Python and distributed with its own virtual environments.  The MES is designed to be hosted on Linux, with all of its dependencies in a single container.

Building
----------
Run the _build-script.sh_.

This script is interactive and will download items and create a server “package root” as a tarball.  Site-specific configuration is embedded in the _init-script.sh_ script in the tarball.

The _build-script.sh_ needs Internet access.  It grabs current versions of the open source items it needs from the Internet.

Installing
----------
1. Copy the package root tarball to the target server and expand it in a directory of your choosing.
2. Run the _init-script.sh_ with the _install_ argument as root; for example:
<pre>
tar -xvf munki-enrollment-server-2016.09.tgz
sudo ./munki-enrollment-server/init-script.sh install
</pre>
3. When installing, the script will pause and give you an opportunity to edit or resstore these configuration files for the MES:
   * *&lt;container&gt;/mes_virtualenv/mes/configuration.plist*
   * *&lt;container&gt;/mes_virtualenv/mes/munki_client_prefs.plist*

To upgrade or install a new version of the package, simpy repeat the installation steps.

### Security Notes ###
The Munki Enrollment Server _could_ run as root, but we run it with a designed user account called _munki-enrollment-server_ for added security.

The _munki-enrollment-server_ user account needs to have access to the Munki repository as specified here.  Note access can be granted by virtue of it being a member of a group, and regular POSIX permissions or POSIX ACLs may be set on the Munki repository:
   * *Munki Repository*:  The MES should have read and execute permissions to the top-level of the munki repository.
      * *Manifests Directory*:  The MES should have read, write, and execute permissions to the _manifests_ repository therein.
   * *Private key for the CA*:  The MES needs to have read permission to the CA's private key.  This key is used to sign the certificates that it dispenses to clients.

Unless running in DEBUG mode, the MES only binds to 127.0.0.1:3000.  Thus, requests from clients must go through a “front end” reverse proxy web server, where you can perform authentication if desired.

Authors & Sources
----------
### By GSU ###
   * The following items were created by Gerrit DeWitt (gdewitt@gsu.edu).
      * This file, _ReadMe.md_
      * Other notes in the _Documentation_ directory
      * The _build-script.sh_
      * The _init-script-template.sh_ (and, consequently, the _init-script.sh_ as generated by the _build-script.sh_)
      * The various Python scripts that compose the MES (in _src-mes_).
         * The MEC and MES were created by Gerrit DeWitt (gdewitt@gsu.edu), but the overall idea for the project is not novel.  For example, a project called “Munki Manifest Selector” (noted in Sources) captures the overall design goal.
   * This container was compiled by Gerrit DeWitt (gdewitt@gsu.edu) using other open source items.  For license terms, authors, and references, refer to the Sources section.
   * Special thanks to Jane Eason (jeason@gsu.edu) for pointers and assistance with managing process PIDs on Linux.

Organization
----------
Top level items in this repository are:
* _build-script.sh_: A shell script that builds a “container” for deployment to a server.  It needs Internet access to download the various components.
* _init-script-template.sh_: A shell script that serves as a template for the _init-script.sh_ included in the container that's produced.
* _ReadMe.md_ and _Documentation_: This file and other documentation.
* _src-mes_: A directory containing Python scripts and configuration files that compose the MES.  These are moved into a Python virtual environment by the _build-script.sh_.

When built, the NetBoot server container has the following layout:
* _build.log_: The build log created by the _build-script.sh_.
* _init-script.sh_: The shell script responsible for loading and installing the software.  Created by the _build-script.sh_ from _init-script-template.sh_.
* _mes_virtualenv_: Portable pypy virtual environment for BSDPy and its dependencies.
   * _mes_: Code and configuration files for the MES.  Some configuration plist files are stored here, too.

Methods
----------
### Python Dependencies ###
Python dependencies are those modules not included with the pypy runtime by default are sourced and added when the _build-script.sh_ runs.  It downloads and installs the necessary dependencies in the virtual environment it creates.  This virtual environment is created using tools included with _pypy_; _pip_ is the method for obtaining the dependencies.
